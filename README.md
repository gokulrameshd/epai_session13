# epai_session13 - Assignment

In this assignment we have two modules,

1 . polygons
2 . polygon_sequence


## Polygons:
- This module helps us to create  convex polygons for the given number of sides and circumferential radii

- It also gives us the attributes of the polygons
  - Area
  - Inner edge
  - Angle
  - Apothem
  - perimeter

# Polygon_sequence:
- This module helps us the create the polygon sequence for given number of sides.
- It also helps us to find the max efficient polygon.

#  S13
-  Jupyter notebook contains, the testing of the two modules
